### About the Thermo-Shield
The Thermo-Shield for arduino allows a board to acquire environmental data collected by an array of sensors. These sensors consist of thermocouple, IR sensor, digital thermometer, analog temperature sensor and resistance temperature detector.

## Hardware

### 3D shield casing 
We design a 3D visualization of our thermo-shield using the Fusion 360 cloud-based 3D CAD/CAM software which allowed us to better approach real-world problems right away from comfort of our home. Our specialized team produced astonishing model for our arduino shield project. The dimensions of this particular prototype are: ..x..x.. The process of homogenization is achieved through pair of vents that make a circulation and flow of hot air created by Peltier cooling module mainly focused on installed sensors and supported by an inner radiator. The air flows through sophicticated hole at the bottom of the wall between the vents and the sensors. All of the componets are packed to lightweight materials to secure transferability as well as maneuverability. This was the demanded property. Several additional changes were made to protect both the PCB and the componets of external energy. The goal that we have been searching for was acceptable balance between the price and those two factors. The last but not least was the issue of maintanance that expected the whole product to be easy to repair if necessary. Our skilled specialist took lead of this approach and came up with the following design.
